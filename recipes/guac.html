    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe Avocados</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>1/4 cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>1 small tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of the lime over the avocado to prevent browning and add a tangy flavor.</li>
        <li>Mash the avocados with a fork or a potato masher until you achieve your desired consistency (smooth or slightly chunky).</li>
        <li>Add the diced red onion, tomato, cilantro, and minced garlic to the bowl.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Start with a small amount and adjust as needed.</li>
        <li>Gently mix all the ingredients together until well combined.</li>
        <li>Taste the guacamole and adjust the lime juice, salt, or other ingredients to your preference.</li>
        <li>Transfer the guacamole to a serving bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, ensuring the wrap touches the surface of the guacamole to prevent browning.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve with tortilla chips, vegetable sticks, or as a topping for tacos, burritos, or salads. Enjoy!</li>
